Protecting trees depends on the ability of many different groups to care for, or steward, trees. Yet tree stewardship varies widely across urban neighborhoods and cities, and we still have much to learn about how it works and where it's most effective. By analyzing how groups collaborate and the specific stewardship activities they perform—such as tree planting, maintenance, or advocacy—researchers and government partners can identify opportunities to coordinate more effectively, share limited resources, and reduce redundancy. Importantly, this knowledge also helps highlight areas that may be underserved or ecologically vulnerable, such as neighborhoods with limited stewardship activity or declining urban forest conditions By mapping and analyzing stewardship networks, cities can make more informed and equitable decisions about where and how to invest in the long-term care of their urban forests.</p>
